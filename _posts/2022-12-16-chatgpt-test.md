## Register

* Register fot ChatGPT on the [OpenAI website](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/), it is free at the moment! 
* You can use your Microsoft/Google account for this.
* You can start playing around immediately [here](https://chat.openai.com/chat)
* Note this service is super busy, with something like a million users registering in 5 days. [Read more](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ariannajohnson/2022/12/07/heres-what-to-know-about-openais-chatgpt-what-its-disrupting-and-how-to-use-it/).

## Python Wrapper

I wanted to make something useable on the command-line so went searching. People did not disappoint - turns out a wrapper already exists for Python, you can get it [here](https://github.com/mmabrouk/chatgpt-wrapper)

You run an interactive session on command line:
* `pip install git+https://github.com/mmabrouk/chatgpt-wrapper` 
* I had to run `playwright install` before running below install command
* `chatgpt install`
* A browser window will open where you can log in using your OpenAI account.
* Once logged in, I had to run `session` command in the interactive session. 
* You can then interact with ChatGPT normally.

This is nice, but what I really want is some sort of command line tool that makes my life easier as a developer. GitHub Copilot already does much of this I hear, in terms of code completion etc.. I've never tested it myself so can't comment but what I would like to try and achieve here is a utility that helps me in my day job, for example in writing Terraform scripts.

To do this I'm going to use the ChatGPT class provided in [mmabrouk's](https://github.com/mmabrouk/chatgpt-wrapper) wrapper. You can achieve a "streaming" experience where the response is streamed in a "typing" like manner:

```python
from chatgpt_wrapper import ChatGPT
import sys

bot = ChatGPT()

for iterator in bot.ask_stream(sys.argv[1]):
    sys.stdout.write(iterator)
    sys.stdout.flush()
```

Which you can then use from the command line:

P.S. I used [this article](https://medium.com/@pczarkowski/how-to-make-an-animated-gif-of-your-terminal-commands-62b08dfb6089) to produce the animated command line action gifs.

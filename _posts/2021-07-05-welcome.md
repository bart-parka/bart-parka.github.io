I thought it fitting to kick-off by walking through the steps of setting this up. Below you can find a step by step guide on how to setup a similar blog page for yourself.

## Requirements

* Ruby version 2.4.0 or higher, including all development headers (check your Ruby version using `ruby -v`)
* RubyGems (check your Gems version using `gem -v`)
* GCC and Make (check versions using `gcc -v`,`g++ -v`, and `make -v`)
* GitHub account

Fork https://github.com/mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter (You can use [this link](https://github.com/mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter/generate)), name it as follows: `<github-username>.github.io` and initialise with a README (more info [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site)).

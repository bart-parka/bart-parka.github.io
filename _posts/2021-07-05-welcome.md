I thought it fitting to kick-off by walking through the steps of setting this up. Below you can find a step by step guide on how to setup a similar blog page for yourself.

## Requirements

* Ruby version 2.4.0 or higher, including all development headers (check your Ruby version using `ruby -v`)
* RubyGems (check your Gems version using `gem -v`)
* GCC and Make (check if installed using `gcc -v`,`g++ -v`, and `make -v`)
* GitHub account

## Guide

The following instructions assume a macOS workstation. You can find detailed instructions for your operating system by navigating to the relevant links seen below.

1. Follow instruction here to [install Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/)

2. Fork https://github.com/mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter (You can use [this link](https://github.com/mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter/generate)), name it as follows:  
`<github-username>.github.io` (more info [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site)).

3. Under your repository name, click Settings. In the left sidebar, click Pages.

4. Click your site's URL to see your published page.

5. Clone the repo and make changes locally (most of the basic configuration is in `_config.yml`), each time you push to master your page will update.

6. You can develop and test locally, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:4000` on your browser.

### Bonus Steps

To add some flavour to your new blog page, the minimial mistakes theme allows for easy customisation. I have done the following:

1. Change your theme, I've gone for a dark theme which is easy on the eyes. Add the following line in your `_config.yml`:
```yml
minimal_mistakes_skin: dark
```

2. Add a profile picture or avatar. First move the avatar file into the repository folder (you'll have to commit it to git). For best results make the image square. Under author in `_config.yml`, add a path to your image:
```yml
author:
  name   : "Bart Parka"
  avatar : "/assets/profile-square.jpg"
```

3. To include an overlay image at the top of your post, add the following to the top of your post markdown file:
```markdown
header:
  overlay_image: /assets/welcome-post.jpg
  overlay_filter: 0.3 # This is for opacity
  caption: "Photo credit: [**Stefan Miron**](https://www.flickr.com/photos/barrycandlemaker)"
```

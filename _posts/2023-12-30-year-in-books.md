This tweet is referring to recent events increasing tension in the relationship between Latvia and Russia. On April 1, 2021, the Russian Foreign Ministry declared that Latvian Ambassador Andrejs Pildegovičs would be declared ‘persona non grata’ and given two weeks to leave the country. The ministry accused the ambassador of taking “steps to stir up unacceptable and hostile activity” in Russia. Latvia denied the accusations, and strongly condemned Russia’s decision. The Baltic nation has also requested the European Union to deal with the incident. This is the latest incident in a series of disputes between Latvia and Russia, including militarization of the former Soviet Union nation and what Latvian officials call Russia’s “continuing attempts at influencing its eastern neighbors.”

in Ukraine due to a nationwide power outage caused by Russian cyber-infrastructure strikes. Most areas in eastern Ukraine and the Donbass region have been without electricity for up to a week due to an attack on power and communication lines by Russia. The power outages have paralyzed production and put a severe strain on the nation’s dairy industry and other food companies.

The power outages have put an immense strain on Ukraine’s food production, leading some food companies to shut down production temporarily and relocate manufacturing to neighboring countries. Companies have had to limit orders and delivery, resulting in a disruption in the local food supply chain. The Russian infrastructure strikes have created a shortage of food in Ukraine and have had a significant effect on the nation’s economy. The lack of electricity has caused a disruption in production, leading to higher prices and shortages of essential foods like milk and butter. The economy could suffer further if the Russian infrastructure strikes continue.

The US has been actively providing Ukraine with military aid such as drones and other equipment to deter Russia from further aggression. North Korea believes that by supplying defensive equipment to Ukraine, the US is further contributing to the militarization of the region.

This is a tongue-in-cheek tweet highlighting the fact that Flybe, a low cost regional airline, is in financial trouble and planning to cease operations. As a result, they are no longer operating flights to Manchester Airport. By suggesting that passengers "proceed as planned" they will not get to the airport, the tweeter is highlighting how Flybe's situation has disrupted passengers' travel plans.

My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4601512545">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
A dense, incredibly informative book that was clearly meticulously researched. It was at times a bit of a slog but that is unsurprising given the topics covered. Overall, I learned a lot but would only recommend to people with deep interest in the subject matter.

My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5086154493">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
Really enjoyed this one. The author outlines a compelling argument for how the "infrastructure of opportunity" of certain groups (who are starved of opportunities early in life or are otherwise disadvantaged by race, class or gender) prevents individuals from gaining top education and work. The author then explains why this should concern all of us and what steps one can take to help. I particularly enjoyed the parallels drawn between post-industrial declines in the US, UK and Russia and the personal accounts and experiences given by the author (especially the eviscerating first-hand account of gross mismanagement during the Trump administration). Would have given 5 stars but felt some chapters in the second half of the book could have been more concise.
